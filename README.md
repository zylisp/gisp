# gisp

Simple (non standard) compiler of Lisp/Scheme to Go.

## Status

Extant. Project has been largely abandoned since 2014, but I decided to bring
together the available source code and have a Go (pun intended) at it as a
weekend project.

## Includes

- Lexer based on Rob Pike's
  [Lexical Scanning in Go](https://talks.golang.org/2011/lex.slide)
- Simple recursive parser, supporting ints, floats, strings, bools
- TCO via loop/recur
- AST generating REPL included


## Development

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:zylisp/gisp.git
$ cd gisp
$ export GOPATH=$GOPATH:`pwd`
$ export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/bin
$ make
```

## Usage

From here you can type in forms and you'll get the Go AST back.
To compile a file:

```
> ./gisp filename.gsp
```

## Functions

```
+, -, *, mod, let, if, ns, def, fn, all pre-existing Go functions
```

See [examples](examples) for some Project Euler solutions
